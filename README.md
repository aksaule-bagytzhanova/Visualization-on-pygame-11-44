Visualization of the task as a game

Task: 

44. A light rope passes over a light,
frictionless pulley. One end is fastened
to a bunch of bananas of
mass M, and a monkey of mass M
clings to the other end (Fig. P11.44).
The monkey climbs the rope in
an attempt to reach the bananas.
(a) Treating the system as consisting
of the monkey, bananas, rope,
and pulley, find the net torque on
the system about the pulley axis.
(b) Using the result of part (a),
determine the total angular momentum
about the pulley axis and describe the motion of
the system. (c) Will the monkey reach the bananas?
